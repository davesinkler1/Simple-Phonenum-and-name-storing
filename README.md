Simple-Phonenum-and-name-storing
================================
was a python project which was intended to test my python
coding ability because at that time i haven't coded in python for a long time  
and to also familiarize myself again with python so, what better way to start  
than with this simple project? the project is for storing phone numbers and names 
inputted by the user

Deployment
==========
Simply type this command into your command line or terminal:
<p>
python phonename.py
</p>
